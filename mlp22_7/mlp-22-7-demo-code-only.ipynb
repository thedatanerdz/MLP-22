Fisher Score- Chisquare  Test For Feature Selection","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Compute chi-squared stats between each non-negative feature and class.\n\n- This score should be used to evaluate categorical variables in a classification task.\n\nThis score can be used to select the n_features features with the highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must contain only non-negative features such as booleans or frequencies (e.g., term counts in document classification), relative to the classes.\n\nRecall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic variables, so using this function “weeds out” the features that are the most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for classification.\nThe Chi Square statistic is commonly used for testing relationships between categorical variables.\n\nIt compares the observed distribution of the different classes of target Y among the different categories of the feature, against the expected distribution of the target classes, regardless of the feature categories.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as
